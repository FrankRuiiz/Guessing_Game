#Guessing Game

**About The Project**

The purpose of this project was to introduce basic JavaScript concepts and logic. Over time I have refactored the code to be Object Oriented, added additional animations to indicate how close or far a user's guess is to the secret number, and implemented responsive design.


**Features Implemented**

*Object Oriented Programming
*CSS3 & jQuery Animations (transitions)
*Responsive Design (Bootstrap)
